A party’s “Confidential Information” shall not include information that: (a) is or becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the other party; (b) was in the other party’s lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained by the other party either directly or indirectly from the disclosing party; (c) is lawfully disclosed to the other party by a third party without restriction on disclosure; (d) is independently developed by the other party; or (e) is required to be disclosed by any judicial or governmental requirement or order (provided that, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law, recipient timely advises the disclosing party of the governmental demand for disclosure); and (e) is disclosed to any banking, financial or credit institution in order to comply with relevant KYC/AML obligations that may be imposed for the purposes of opening, maintaining or operating a bank account in the Seller’s name.

7.3.	No Public Announcements.  The Purchaser may announce that it has entered into the Agreement with the Seller to acquire the Tokens but may not, without the prior written consent of the Seller, make any other public announcements, issue any media release or similar publicity relating to any of the terms or provisions of the Agreement including, without limitation, any economic terms included in the Agreement.  Neither party shall use the trademarks, tradename, logo or other intellectual property rights of the other party without having obtained its prior written consent.

7.4.	Specific Performance.  Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies that each party may have, each party acknowledges and agrees that damages alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of the terms of this Section 7 by the other party.  Accordingly, each party shall be entitled to the remedies of injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of this Section 7.

### 8.	DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY ARBITRATION
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CLAUSE CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS CERTAIN PROVISIONS, SUCH AS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT THE PURCHASER’S LEGAL RIGHTS. THIS SECTION REQUIRES THE PURCHASER TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH THE SELLER AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE PURCHASER CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM THE SELLER.   

8.1.	Binding Arbitration.  Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) in which either party seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, the Purchaser and the Seller each (i) waive their respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to this Agreement resolved in a court and (ii) waive their respective rights to a jury trial.  Instead, the Purchaser and the Seller agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).

8.2.	No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions. Any Dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement is personal to the Purchaser and the Seller and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.  There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another person or group of persons.  Further, a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals. 

8.3.	Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution. Each party will notify the other party in writing of any Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally.  Notice to the Seller shall be sent by e-mail to privatejetcoin@protonmail.com.  Notice to the Purchaser shall be sent to the address set forth on the signature line to this Agreement or to such other address as may be provided to the Seller in writing. If the Purchaser and the Seller cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date that the notice is received by the applicable party, then either party may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 8, make a request for arbitration or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 8.1, file a claim in court.

8.4.	Process.  The seat and venue of the arbitration shall be the Republic of Seychelles].  The arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator appointed by the International Chamber of Commerce in accordance with the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration, which are hereby incorporated by reference. 

8.5.	Authority of Arbitrator.  The arbitrator will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative or class action, which is prohibited by this Agreement.  The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.

8.6.	Severability of Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provisions. If any term, clause or provision of this Section 8 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent applicable and required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 8 will remain valid and enforceable.  Further, the waivers set forth in Section 8.2 above are severable from the other provisions of this Agreement and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.

## SCHEDULE B

### TOKEN FUNCTIONALITY

The Tokens are a virtual currency to be used on the Platform.  The Tokens implement a macro-econometric oracle feature to endogenously govern their own maximum supply once forged (i.e. mined) to an initial limit. The Seller expects to create digital currencies similar to the Tokens for each country that reliably reports GDP.  Tokens are intended to share a simplified set of traits withdomestic fiat so that residents may select away from the short-run decisions of their central bank while still retaining money tethered to the long-run progress of the applicable national economy.

The Tokens have three key features.  First, they are forged via a proof-of-stake approach.  Second, stakeholders may elect to add (and later delete) personal information to satisfy anti-money laundering and KYC laws and regulations.  Third, once fully distributed, the rate of change in the minable (i.e. forgeable) supply of a Token parallels the rate of change in the GDP of the country to which the Token relates. 

The Tokens can be used on the Platform (i) as a medium of exchange, (ii) fa unit of account, (iii) a store of value, or (iv) in connection with other usage as more fully described in the Seller’s Whitepaper.

The Seller does not believe that the Tokens are securities as such term is defined under the U.S. Securities Act and related regulations.  However, no assurance can be made that the SEC would reach the same conclusion.  Accordingly, the Tokens are being distributed only outside of the United States to non-U.S. persons as such term is defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act.  
The Tokens are not intended for speculative investment.  The Seller makes no promises of future performance or future value of the Tokens. 

Holding the Tokens is in no way the equivalent of holding a share of stock in the Seller; it does not allow the token holder to participate in Seller decision making, profits, revenue share, or otherwise; and the Tokens or holders of the Tokens (“Tokenholders”) have no rights in the Seller, implied or otherwise.  Importantly, Tokenholders should have no expectation of profiting from their purchase of the Tokens.  
 
## SCHEDULE C

### RISKS

(a)	Software Weaknesses:  The Platform, the Tokens and the underlying software application (i.e. the Ethereum blockchain or other) are subject to ongoing development and many aspects remain unproven.  There is no warranty or assurance that the process for creating and issuing the Tokens will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the complete loss of the Tokens or ETH.  Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptographic coins and to the Platform.  The Tokens and the Platform may be based on the Ethereum protocol.  As such, any malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the Ethereum protocol may cause the Platform or the Tokens to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner.

(b)	Uncertain Regulatory Framework:  The regulatory status of cryptographic coins, digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions.  It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities will regulate such technologies.  It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations or rules that will affect cryptographic tokens, coins, digital assets, blockchain technology and its applications.  Such changes could negatively impact the Tokens in various ways, including, for example, through a determination that the Tokens are regulated financial instruments that require registration.  As a result, the Seller could make a determination that is required or in the best interests of the Seller to cease the distribution of the Tokens or the development of the Platform entirely, or that it is required or in the best interests of the Seller or cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so in that jursidiction.  Blockchain activities, including the Platform, could be impacted by a number of regulatory initiatives or developments in multiple jurisdictions including with respect to consumer privacy and protection, data privacy and protection, cyber security, intellectual property rights and protections, and other new categories of laws and regulations.  Such regulatory initiatives and developments could significantly impact the Token Functionality.

(c)	Government Action:  Because of the regulatory uncertainty described above, blockchain activities, including the activities of the Seller and the Platform may be subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny, including investigations or enforcement actions.  There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not examine the operations of the Seller or pursue regulatory or enforcement actions against the Seller.  Such governmental activities, if they were to occur, might or might not be the result of targeting the Seller in particular.  All of this could subject the Seller to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties or require or cause the Seller to restructure its operations and activities, to cease offering certain products or services in one or more jurisdictions or refrain from delivering the Tokens to certain persons or in certain jurisdictions.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, the reputation of the Seller and the ability of the Seller to continue to develop the Platform could be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Tokens.

(d)	Insufficient Interest:  The creation and issue of the Tokens and the development of the Platform may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (for example, caused by competing projects).  There is no assurance that, even if the Platform is developed as contemplated by the Whitepaper, the Purchaser will receive any benefits through the the Tokens received pursuant to the Agreement.  Aspects of the Platform may require third party development support.  There is no assurance that those third parties will complete their required work or properly carry out their obligations. 

(e)	Risk Associated With Other Applications:  It is possible that alternative platforms and businesses could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the Platform.  The Platform may compete with these alternative platforms and businesses, which could negatively impact the adoption of the Platform and the Tokens.  In addition, the Platform may give rise to other, alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which the Tokens will have reduced, or potentially no, intrinsic value.  There is a risk that the Seller or its representatives, or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Platform interfering with the use of, or causing the loss of, the Tokens.

(f)	Loss of Private Key:  The Tokens can only be accessed by using a digital wallet with a combination of the Purchaser’s account information (address), private key and password.  The private key is encrypted with a password.  The Purchaser understands and accepts that if the private key or password gets lost or stolen, the the Tokens associated with the Purchaser’s account (address) or password may be unrecoverable and permanently lost.  Additionally, any third party that gains access to the Purchaser’s private key, including by gaining access to the login credentials relating to the Purchaser’s digital wallet, may be able to misappropriate the Purchaser’s the Tokens.

(g)	Theft:  The smart contract used to generate the Tokens and the underlying software application (for example, the Ethereum blockchain) may be exposed to attacks by hackers or other individuals including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.  Any such successful attacks could result in theft or loss of Purchases or the Tokens, adversely impacting the ability to use or develop the Platform and derive any usage or functionality from the Tokens.

(h)	The Tokens/Other Blockchain Mining Attacks:  As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain being used for the Tokens is susceptible to mining attacks, including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks.  Any successful attacks present a risk to the Tokens and the Platform, expected proper execution and sequencing of the Tokens transactions, and expected proper execution and sequencing of contract computations.

(i)	Incompatible Wallet Service:  The wallet or wallet service provider used for the Purchase has to be technically compatible with the Tokens.  The failure to assure this may have the result that the Purchaser will not gain access to the delivered the Tokens.

(j)	Development Risk:  The timing for issuing the Tokens and for completing various steps in the implementation of the Platform are set forth in the Whitepaper.  However there is no assurance that the Seller will meet those target dates.  The Purchaser understands that the date on which the Seller intends to deliver the Tokens to the Purchaser could be delayed.  The Platform operationality may be limited at the time of Tokens delivery and not all of the anticipated operational features intended for the Platform may be functioning at that time.  The Platform will still be subject to ongoing development and could undergo significant changes over time.  In addition, because the development of the Platform may be depended on third parties, the Seller may have limited control over future the Token Functionality or in assuring the ongoing operation and performance of the Platform. 

(k)	Risk of Unfavorable Fluctuation of Currency Value:  Proceeds received shall be immediately leveraged to fund the development of the Platform, market adoption and other business operating expenses.  If the value of ETH fluctuates unfavorably, the Seller may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Platform in the manner that it intended. 

(l)	No Liquidity: The Tokens are not intended for investment purposes.  The Token holders may not be able to sell, transfer or trade the Tokens to any other party.  The Tokens are intended to be used only in connection with the Platform.  There may never be a secondary market for the Tokens.  The Tokens may be subject to significant transfer restrictions as a result of actions taken by the Seller or by government regulators. 

(m)	Money Transmission:  The Seller has not determined whether it is a money transmitter (“MT”) or a money services business (“MSB”).  If the Seller was deemed to be an MT or MSB, it would be subject to significant additional regulation in the United States, the Republic of Seychelles, and in potentially other jurisdictions as well.  This could lead to significant changes with respect to the Platform, how the Tokens are structured, how they are purchased and sold, and other issues, and could greatly increase the Seller’s costs in creating and facilitating transactions in the Tokens.  It could also lead to termination of the Tokens.  A regulator could take action against the Seller if it were to view the Tokens as violating existing laws.  Any of these outcomes could force the Seller to cease operations. 

(n)	Risk of Uninsured Losses:  Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds or cryptocurrencies held using the Platform (directly or indirectly) are generally uninsured. In the event of any loss, there is no public insurer, such as the FDIC, or private insurer, to offer recourse to the Purchaser.

(o)	Risk of Dissolution of the Seller: It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of ETH, development issues with the Platform, the failure of business relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the Platform or Seller may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch. 

(p)	Proposed Future Activities:  Certain of the future services contemplated by the Seller could subject the Seller and related entities to various regulatory requirements in the United States that could require that the Seller or such related entities register as a broker-dealer, investment adviser or an exchange under applicable U.S. securities laws.  There is no assurance that the Seller or its affiliates would be able to obtain such required registrations or whether the Seller would choose to do so.  If the Seller or such related entities is unable to obtain such registrations that could result in the Seller deciding not to offer those future services.

(q)	Taxation:  The tax characterization of the Tokens is uncertain.  Purchasers must seek their own tax advice in connection with the acquisition, transfer and use of the Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences, including, without limitation, withholding taxes, transfer taxes, value added taxes, income taxes and similar taxes, levies, duties or other charges and tax reporting requirements.

(r)	Unanticipated Risks: Blockchain and cryptography are new and untested technologies. In addition to the risks discussed in this Agreement, there are risks that the Seller cannot anticipate. Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or new risks may emerge.
